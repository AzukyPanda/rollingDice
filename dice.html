 would start getting a velocity that depends on the accelerometer (plus or minus, let's say, 20%) and random angular speeds for the dice.
Then, find the trajectory for each and when touching a border.
Bounce them to one direction or another depending on the rotation at that particular moment.
Change the sign of the angular speed if the dice bounce back.
Reduce the speed about 50% each bounce, until a threshold.
Below that threshold, leave them in the floor and stop movement.
